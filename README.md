# SQL 50 Days Challenge 🚀

This repository is my 50-day SQL learning journey.

Every day I:
- Watch an SQL lecture  
- Practice 5–10 queries  
- Save them in a `.sql` file  
- Commit them to GitHub  

Goal:
- Build strong SQL fundamentals  
- Stay consistent with daily practice  
- Maintain a GitHub streak  
- Create a public SQL portfolio
